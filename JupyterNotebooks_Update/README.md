# Hot off the press: Updates of the JupyterNotebook franchise

[Peter Oxley](mailto:pro2004@med.cornell.edu) attended [JupyterCon](https://conferences.oreilly.com/jupyter/jup-ny), a Jupyter Conference organized by O'Reilly, and he was kind enough to share some of the coolest news and updates with us!

For a general intro to Jupyter Notebooks, you can see last year's session [here](https://github.com/abcdbug/dbug/tree/master/JupyterNotebooks) or [Peter's](https://github.com/oxpeter/library_bioinformatics_service/tree/master/Jupyter) excellent summary.

The three main new developments that we discussed were:

* [JupyterLab](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab), a really cool environment that does not only include the well-known Jupyter notebook, but will also offer terminal, text editor, file browser and other capabilities - including a chat function so you can **work together on the same notebook** with multiple people! Think google docs for Jupyter! It's still in a fairly early development stage, but you can find Peter's very detailed instructions on how to install it and get started [here](https://github.com/oxpeter/library_bioinformatics_service/blob/master/Jupyter/Jupyterlab_install.md)
* [JupyterHub](https://github.com/jupyterhub/jupyterhub), which you can use to create a **multi-user hub** using a single-user Jupyter Notebook server
* [binder](https://beta.mybinder.org/) -- turning your repo full of Jupyter Notebooks into a **collection of interactive notebooks**. Keep an eye on the WCM mailing list as Peter is probably going to demo this some time soon in the WCM Library!
* [ipywidgets](https://github.com/jupyter-widgets/ipywidgets) -- not necessarily the latest news out of JupyterCon, but a cool tool nevertheless

Btw, O'Reilly is now embracing Jupyter Notebooks for real-life, commercial publishing! Check it out [here](https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/jupyter-at-oreilly).
