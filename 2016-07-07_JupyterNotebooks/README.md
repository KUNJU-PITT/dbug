# Jupyter Notebooks

The `.ipynb` file contains the Jupyter Notebook which Greg made for the presentation.

If you __click on the `.ipynb` file__, github will render the notebook so that it looks almost the same way as if you had opened it using Jupyter itself (note that this may take a couple of seconds!)

To __generate a Jupyter notebook__, do the following:

1. install Jupyter, e.g. via Python's package manager `pip`:

	```
	pip install jupyter
	```

2. start a Jupyter session via the command line

	```
	jupyter notebook
	```

 This will open a session in your web browser.
 On the right hand side, you should see a button saying "new" --> use it to start your first notebook which will be saved as an `.ipynb` file.
